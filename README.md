Steam Group Filter Games
=======

Filter Steam group members by what game they're playing.
It also adds a Join Game button if Steam provides it.

Note: This is buggy as it was just released. So try reloading/refreshing the page on the members tab if you don't see the filter bar, it's a common occurence but will get fixed eventually.

Note: If you're worried about this stealing your information, you can always use steam groups while not logged in. I'm planning to create a website that does it for you sometime in the future.
